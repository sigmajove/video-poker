I've been working on some more computer programs, trying to answer
a question of some interest to video poker players.  Namely, how
much money do you need to play the games?

To get an idea, I came up with two scenarios.  First suppose you put $100
into a quarter machine, and keep playing until you reach or pass $200,
either by hitting a big jackpot hand, or a series of smaller wins that 
put you over.  What are the chances of each of these outcomes?

Next suppose you want to start with an amount of money, and keep playing
until you either lose it all, or reach $1000, either by hitting
a royal or getting a series of smaller wins that put you over.  And say
you want to have a 50-50 shot at reaching $1000.  How much money do you
need to start with?

I've answered these questions for the four games for which I've sent you
strategies.  Plus, for each scenario, I've computed the median number of
games you need to play before either reaching the goal or going bust.
When I say that the median is N, it means that half of the time you will
need fewer than N games and half of the time you will need more.

Here are the answers for the four games.

----------------------------------

Full-Pay Deuces Wild

With a bankroll of $100
 2.30% Royal Flush
20.14% Four Deuces
 8.73% Reach $200
68.83% Bust
Median number of games: 796

With a bankroll of $523.75
24.88% Royal
25.03% Reach $1000
50.10% Bust
Median number of games: 8494

----------------------------------

16/10 NSU Deuces Wild

 2.21% Royal Flush
17.91% Four Deuces
 6.93% Reach $200

With a bankroll of $662.50
23.80% Royal
26.10% Reach $1000
50.10% Bust
Median number of games: 8633

----------------------------------

10/7 Double Bonus

With a bankroll of $100
 1.19% Royal Flush
11.48% Quad Aces
25.54% Reach $200
61.79% Bust

----------------------------------

9/6 Jacks or Better

With a bankroll of $100
 3.84% Royal Flush
24.06% Reach $200
72.10% Bust
Median number of games: 1173

With a bankroll of $791.25
39.92% Royal
 9.98% Reach $1000
50.10% Bust
Median number of games: 14777

----------------------------------

What does it all mean?  Well, if you are going for a Royal,
Full-Pay Deuces Wild is your game of choice.  It's the game
that needs the least money to get the most Royals.  NSU Deuces
is similar to Full-Pay Deuces, but all the numbers are a little
bit worse.

Double Bonus has a very different footprint than the Deuces Wild
games.  The money required is in between the two Deuces games.
But you are much more likely to get to $1000 by working your way
up than by getting a Royal.  That's not a good thing, because an
early Royal can net you nearly $1000, whereas working your way up
to $1000 only nets you $420.

Jacks or Better is not a good option for the long term.  A 50-50
shot at $1000 costs nearly $800.  But if you don't want to risk
much money, it's not a bad choice.  Of the four games, it's the one
that is most likely to eat your $100 bill.  However, losing that $100
will take a lot longer on this machine than the others. And each $100
bill you feed it has a much greater chance of hitting a Royal than the
other machines. Plus, it is the game with the simplest strategy.  The problem
with the game is that it doesn't have any jackpots like Four Deuces or Four
Aces, which give $100 bills back. So if you want to have a reasonable chance
of hitting a Royal, all the $100 bills you will have to feed it will come out
of your wallet.
